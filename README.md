# Autodesk Forge AR - WebXR polyfill 

This was a sample exploration using Autodesk Forge and WebXR, we wanted to find a cheaper solution to view AR without of a headset.

We used Autodesk Forge for the translation of Revit files to OBJ in order to load it into the Scene of the WebRX. 

It needs the XRViewer from Mozilla [Link](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/webxr-viewer/id1295998056?mt=8)

And you can head over to this url from the App referenced above.
[Demo](https://jaimerosales.github.io/webxr-polyfill/)

Here are some Videos on how it works.


We started with an empty wall where we wanted to place our AR Kitchen.
